# 📚 DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice repository!  
Here, I upload my solved problems from **GeeksforGeeks** and **LeetCode**, following the structured DSA sheet provided by [**Take U Forward**](https://takeuforward.org/).

---

## 🛤️ Purpose

- To maintain a consistent record of my DSA practice.
- To track my progress topic-wise and company-wise.
- To strengthen problem-solving and coding skills by following a structured path.

---

## 📋 Structure

- Problems are categorized according to **topics** (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.).
- Each problem folder/file will typically include:
  - Problem link (GFG / LeetCode)
  - Problem description (brief)
  - Approach and thought process (optional)
  - Code solution
  - Time and Space complexity analysis (optional but encouraged)

## 📌 Sources

- [Take U Forward - DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## 📈 Progress Tracking

I will update the README (or maintain a `progress.md`) to track my problem-solving journey, marking problems as ✅ when solved.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: Primarily C++ / Python (depending on the problem)
- **Platform**: GFG, LeetCode

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Heaps

- Sliding Window
- and more...

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Complete the full DSA sheet by Take U Forward.
- Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.
- Prepare for coding interviews and contests.

Would you also like me to give you a template for the **folder structure** you could follow inside your repository? 🚀  
(Example: `01_Arrays/`, `02_Strings/`, etc.)  
It'll make it even more organized! 📂
